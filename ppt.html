        <h3><u>Ground Rule</u></h3>
        <p>
            This is the most unhinged event of the year. Anything and everything is fair game, no punches pulled. To ensure all of us have
            a good time and stay safe there is only one ground rule:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>NO FILMING/RECORDING OF ANY KIND DURING PRESENTATIONS</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            That being said, here are the basic rules for PowerPoint night:

                absolutely any topic you want, and can be as offensive or passive as you want it to be.

            Feel free to make a PowerPoint on any of these topics if you would like, or make it over any other topic, these are just
            some examples
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Things I have shoved up my ass</li>
            <li>Why 2 inches is too big</li>
            <li>How to deal with the neighbor's ankle biting dog</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
